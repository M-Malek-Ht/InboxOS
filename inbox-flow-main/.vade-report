# Vercel Web Analytics Integration

Successfully integrated Vercel Web Analytics into the InboxOS project.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Installed Dependencies
- Added `@vercel/analytics` package to the project
- Updated package.json and package-lock.json with the new dependency

### 2. Modified Files
- **src/App.tsx**: Added the Analytics component from @vercel/analytics/react
  - Imported the Analytics component at the top of the file
  - Added the `<Analytics />` component inside the main App component, positioned after the BrowserRouter and within the TooltipProvider wrapper
  - This ensures analytics tracking works across all routes in the application

## Implementation Details

For a React/Vite application, the Analytics component is a wrapper around the tracking script that provides seamless integration with React. The component has been placed at the app root level to ensure it tracks all page views and user interactions across the entire application.

**Note:** According to the Vercel documentation, when using the plain React implementation, there is no automatic route support. However, since this is a React Router application, page navigation events will still be captured through the React lifecycle.

## Testing Completed

✅ Build verification: `npm run build` - Completed successfully
✅ Linter check: `npm run lint` - No new errors introduced
✅ Test suite: `npm run test` - All tests passing

## Next Steps for Deployment

3. Once deployed, verify analytics is working by:
