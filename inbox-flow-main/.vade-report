# Vercel Speed Insights Implementation

## Summary
Successfully implemented Vercel Speed Insights for the InboxOS React + Vite application.

## Changes Made

### 1. Package Installation
- Added `@vercel/speed-insights` package to dependencies
- Used npm to install and update `package.json` and `package-lock.json`

### 2. Code Changes
Modified `src/App.tsx`:
- Imported `SpeedInsights` component from `@vercel/speed-insights/react`
- Added `<SpeedInsights />` component to the app structure, placed alongside the existing `<Analytics />` component

### 3. Implementation Details
Following the Vercel Speed Insights documentation for React applications, the `SpeedInsights` component was added as a sibling to the `Analytics` component within the main App component. This ensures that:
- Speed insights tracking is initialized when the app loads
- Performance metrics are collected across all routes
- The implementation follows the same pattern as the existing Analytics integration

## Files Modified
- `package.json` - Added @vercel/speed-insights dependency
- `package-lock.json` - Updated with new package and its dependencies
- `src/App.tsx` - Added SpeedInsights component import and usage

## Testing
- ✅ Build verification: `npm run build` completed successfully
- ✅ Tests: All existing tests pass
- ✅ Linting: No new errors introduced (existing errors are pre-existing)

## Next Steps
After deployment to Vercel:
1. Enable Speed Insights in the Vercel dashboard (Project → Speed Insights tab → Enable)
2. Verify the `/_vercel/speed-insights/script.js` script is loaded in the page
3. Monitor performance metrics in the Vercel dashboard after users visit the site

## Notes
- The implementation follows the official Vercel documentation for React applications
- Speed Insights will only collect data when the application is deployed to Vercel
- The tracking script is automatically scoped at `/_vercel/speed-insights/*` routes after deployment
